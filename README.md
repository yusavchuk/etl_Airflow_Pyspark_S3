Hello, everyone!
This project is my simulation of real ETL process. 
I downloaded files from https://datasets.imdbws.com/ --> 
transformed them with PySpark --> 
pushed to AWS S3 bucket. 
All this work I scheduled with Apache Airflow.
I know, this project has tons of hardcoding)) In future, I am going to do similar project, but will run with Docker.
